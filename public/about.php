    <h2>About Us</h2>

    	<p>When I adopted my first dog, Honey, she was six months old, completely unsocialized, and terrified of <i>everything</i>. 
    	To anyone who has experience in socializing dogs, you know that socializing a dog older than a few months may be quite 
    	difficult - especially when they are so scared of the world, in general.</p>

    		<i>Day 1: I tried petting her, and she somehow fit underneath my bed.</i>
    	</center></p>

   		<p>I was living on my own, with a 9-to-5, and wanted to rescue a dog in need. Honey's heart spoke out to me. This poor girl 
    	looked scared beyond belief, and I had the time and love to give. The rescue group warned me that she would need <i>a lot</i>
    	of love. I said, "No problem! I have a lot to give!" and went on my way.</p>

    		<i>Day 10: Only allowed to pet her if I am also laying on the floor, completely level with her.</i>
    	</center></p>

    	<p>Long story short, I needed more than love to help socialize her. I was a new dog owner, who had only ever been surrounded by
    	other dogs that were fully socialized. I had no idea what I was in for. I felt like I was doing more harm than good - she would
    	sit there depressed all day, and constantly run from me... <b>until I moved in with a relative who had several dogs.</b> The dogs
     	seemed to tell her, "These humans are totes cool, girl." She accepted that. She took on their routine very quickly, and she 
     	eventually even started to wag her tail. The socialization process was much quicker once she had a few completely socialized dogs 
     	around to show her the ropes.</p>

     	<p>I had to move out, though, and while we gained another human (my boyfriend, her now dad!), we lost her doggie companions 
     	that had been so vital to her socialization. She had grown a lot, but she was only a year old. She <i>had to stay socialized</i>. 
     	How the crap were we supposed to do that, short of adopting another dog?</p>

     	<p><b>Dog parks.</b> She was able to expend all of that energy, and constantly surround herself with new friends. I loved seeing 
 		her so happy, especially since she is a very anxious dog, and our move wasn't something she was particularly thrilled about. 
 		(She developed really awful allergies, and at first she wouldn't even eat or drink much)</p>
     		
     	<p>At these dog parks, I met a lot of other really kind, <i>responsible</i> dog owners. We obviously already had something in common - 
 		we loved our dogs enough to bring them somewhere they can get some true joy. I've met some great friends at our dog parks. 
 		I've moved so many times in my life, and found meeting new people so hard when you're out of school. I would have one or two, 
 		but they would be coworkers, and we never really "clicked." With dog parks though... it's second nature. It was like I was back 
 		in school again!</p>

    		<i>Now: Happy as can be.</i>
    	</center></p>

     	<p>Honey was socialized enough, and had learned enough from professional training classes, that I could take her to dog parks. 
 		It's really important that you don't take a completely unsocialized dog to dog park, though - that's asking for accidents 
 		like innocent dogs or even humans getting injured. Talk to your vet before taking your dog to a dog park.</p>
